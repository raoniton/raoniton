## Hi there! I'm Raoniton ✌🏾😊
- #### ```🎓 I'm a Computer Engeneering student at UNICAMP(State University of Campinas), working to earn my first degree.```<br><br>

- 📧 I’ll start applying for internships in a few months, to learn more and test what I already know.

- 💻 In college, I worked with several programming languages, including 
C, Java, JavaScript, Python, HDL, and Haskell.

  - Among these, I spent the most time coding in C. Currently, I’m focusing on improving my Python skills <br><br>
- ```♿️ I'm a person with a disability, so I’ve learned to adapt to different challenges in my life, and I keep pushing forward.```

- ⚡ Fun fact: My name is uncomum in Brazil, so people often mispronounce it. To make things easier, you can call me ```Rao/Raô```(it's like 'How' / 'Ha - o') 😂😉
